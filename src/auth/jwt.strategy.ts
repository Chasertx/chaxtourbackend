/**
 * This JwtStrategy defines how JWTs should be extracted from the request, verified, and the payload processed to extract user information. The core flow is:

The JWT token is extracted from the Authorization header.
The JWT is verified using the JWT_SECRET key.
If the JWT is valid, the userâ€™s ID and email are returned and added to the request (req.user), making it available for use in your route handlers or guards.
This is typically used for authentication and authorization in your NestJS application, allowing you to secure routes by verifying the JWT token in incoming requests.
